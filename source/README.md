# BCNN_keras
Bilinear CNN is simple yet powerful model for Fine-Grained Visual Classification task.  
it is still competitive though developed more than 3 years ago.

In this demo, I implemented B-CNN D-D model with keras.  
B-CNN leverage pre-trained networks.  
D-D model use two identical VGG16 as backbone.
